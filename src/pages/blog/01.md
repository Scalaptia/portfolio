In today's competitive tech landscape, having a strong online presence is crucial. Let's explore how to build a modern developer portfolio using Astro and React.

## Why Astro?

Astro offers the perfect balance between static site generation and dynamic components. Here's a simple example of an Astro component:

```astro
---
const { title } = Astro.props;
---
<header>
  <h1>{title}</h1>
</header>
```

## Adding Interactivity with React

While Astro handles the static content brilliantly, React shines for interactive elements:

```jsx
const ProjectCard = ({ title, description }) => {
  return (
    <div className="card hover:scale-105 transition-transform">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Performance Considerations

One key advantage of this stack is the minimal JavaScript sent to the client. Astro's partial hydration means we only ship JavaScript where it's needed.

## Next Steps

- Implement dark mode
- Add blog functionality
- Optimize images
- Improve accessibility
